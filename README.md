# Maze Solver

This is a ***very*** rudimentary maze solver.

It doesn't use any fancy algorithms, nor does it solve mazes fast - it's only purpose is to get to
the end of the maze *somehow*, *somewhen*.

# How to use

`python solve.py -h` will show possible arguments.

The solver accepts an image of a maze as input.

Example input:
<img src="mazes/test_maze.png" alt="example maze" width=200 height=200 />
